# Platformer Template

The main branch uses Processing in Java to create a rudimentary platformer template. The "Godot" branch is a basic platformer with, well, Godot. This project was originally going to be a game, but I decided to hop into the 3D world so it's just an archive now.

If you'd like to suggest improvements or ask questions feel free to do so! Clone this repo and have fun, I don't mind.
